# Matt's project

This directory contains all the materials associated with Matt's replication.

MOTIVATION
In this project, we will determine whether response time of gendered anaphors is affected when they either match or mismatch a gender-stereotyped antecedent in a self-paced reading trial.

HYPOTHESES
If we replicate the findings of Carreiras et al's 1996 paper, we should find that response time is longer for sentences containing anaphors that do not match the gender of a gender-stereotyped antecedent, with statistical significance.

METHODOLOGY/STIMULI
Subjects view two sentences. The first introduces a character identified only by profession. The second sentence qualifies the first, and refers to the character using an anaphor that either matches or mismatches the stereotypical gender of the character. Reading times for this second sentence are recorded. I have created an MTurk study with the same stimuli as the original paper. I have halved all of the trials â€“ there are 3 practice trials instead of 6, and 30 critical trials instead of 60. I also have decided not to include fillers, due to lack of description of these fillers in the original paper, as well as my belief that the neutral professions serve close to the same purpose. Additionally, because the original paper included very little context for the actual statements and questions being presented consisted of, I wrote my own, with help from Kennison et al (2003). Other than these changes, and the fact that this replication is being done on MTurk, not in person, the methodology is the same as the original experiment.

PREDICTION
I believe we will not confirm the hypothesis - I don't think there will be a statistically significant different in response time between the match and mismatch conditions.

RESULTS
The results of this replication disagree with the major finding of the original paper by Carreiras et al., namely that a mismatch between the gender of an anaphor and the stereotyped gender of its antecedent will impact comprehension in reading tasks. Instead, the replication found that anaphors pointing to neutral antecedents are harder to process than those pointing to gender-stereotyped antecedents, and that there is no significant difference in comprehension between match and mismatch conditions.
