# Matt's project

This directory contains all the materials associated with Matt's replication.

MOTIVATION
In this project, we will determine whether response time is affected by either confirming or subverting the gender of a gender-stereotyped profession in a self-paced reading trial.

HYPOTHESES
If we replicate the findings of Carreiras et al's 1996 paper, we should find that response time is significantly slower for sentences that subvert the gender of a gender-stereotyped profession that came before it.

METHODOLOGY/STIMULI
I have created an MTurk study with the same stimuli as the original paper. I have halved all of the trials â€“ there are 3 practice trials instead of 6, and 30 critical trials instead of 60. I also have decided not to include fillers, due to lack of description of these fillers in the original paper. Additionally, because the original paper included very little context for the actual statements and questions being presented consisted of, I wrote my own, with help from Kennison et al (2003). Other than these changes, and the fact that this replication is being done on MTurk, not in person, the methodology is the same as the original experiment.

PREDICTION
I believe we will not confirm the hypothesis - I don't think there will be a statistically significant different in response time between these two conditions.
